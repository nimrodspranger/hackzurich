In a 40-square-meter room bathed in natural light from a single window, innovation meets functionality. Concrete floors and stark white walls serve as a canvas for a meticulously arranged coworking setup. Dominating the space is a long table, positioned in the room's center and equipped with dual workstations. These stations are each graced by a top-of-the-line laptop and an accompanying external monitor. Flanking the table on opposite ends are two ergonomic chairs designed for comfort during long work hours. Adjacent to this setup, a lockable server rack finds its home on one wall. Directly across, a whiteboard is strategically hung for brainstorming sessions. A set of shelves on the remaining wall houses an array of tech books, fuel for the creative mind. But the room's undisputed focal point is a red 3D printer, positioned centrally on the table, embodying the startup's commitment to cutting-edge technology.
